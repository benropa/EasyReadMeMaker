## Description
This application prompts the user with a series of questions that will create a readme document for your project. One feature of this project is the inclusion of a license selector that provides the user with multiple options to toggle through. The goal of this project is to speed up the process of building a readme file from scratch for every project I create. While creating this project I gained a better understanding of node.js and it's benefits.
